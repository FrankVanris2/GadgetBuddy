# Creating a personal Pipboy AKA GadgetBuddy
I am a personal fan of the fallout franchise ranging down to Fallout 3. I think my favorite game by far will always be Fallout New Vegas. Because of these games I always wanted to create myself my very own pipboy. I 
have always admired those devices in the game. The rustic and classic styles that were implemented in the design made me want to pursue my own creation/version of the pipboy. This is why I will be creating my own 
personal embedded device that resembles a pipboy.

## Plan
Now this isn't a main project, it's more of a hobby project for myself. But I will be treating this project professionally, I will be following the guidelines of the SOLID framework, along with unit testing my code.
I will make sure to do things modular and have no dependencies whatsoever. The pipboy I will be creating will not resemble the pip boy in the images, the goal of this pipboy however is to make sure it has usable 
functionality. This pipboy in general should be considered useful to the user.

## Features
The pipboy (Now known as Gadgetbuddy) I will be creating will have basic user friendly functionality:

1. Temperature/Humidity reader.
2. Time reader.
3. Compass reader.
4. Battery reader.
5. Buttons to switch between different screens.
6. Power on and off.
7. LED's ranging from red, yellow, and green. (To tell user if something is wrong).
8. Simple LCD Screen to project information to the user.

These are the other items that are currently on the wishlist that I would like to add for this project:

1. Radio (obtain specific radio stations).
2. Radio knob (to switch between stations).

## Current Focus
Designing and establishing a codebase that supports modular integrated testing while adhering to SOLID principles. Additionally, leveraging fundamental GitHub skills to enhance the project's usability and efficiency.
