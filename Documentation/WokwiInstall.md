<h1>Wokwi Simulation Guide</h1>

Wokwi is a fantastic online simulator for Arduino, ESP32, and other embedded systems. It allows you to build and run your projects virtually, which is incredibly useful for testing and debugging without needing physical hardware.

<h2>Accessing Wokwi</h2>

Wokwi is primarily a browser-based simulator, meaning you don't need to download any software to get started with its core features. You can simply visit their website and begin building your projects directly in your web browser.

<h2>Wokwi VS Code Extension</h2>

For a more integrated development experience, Wokwi also offers a VS Code extension. This extension allows you to:

* Run simulations directly within your VS Code environment.

* Upload code to your virtual Arduino or ESP32.

* Interact with the simulated hardware.

<h3>Step-by-Step Process to Install Wokwi VS Code Extension:</h3>

1.  **Open VS Code:** Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Go to Extensions View:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (it looks like four squares, one of them flying away). Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).

3. **Search for "Wokwi":** In the search bar at the top of the Extensions view, type "Wokwi" and press Enter.

4. **Select "Wokwi Simulator":** Look for the extension titled "Wokwi Simulator" published by "Wokwi".

5. **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the "Wokwi Simulator" extension.

6. **Reload VS Code (if prompted):** After installation, VS Code might prompt you to reload the window to activate the extension. Click "Reload" or restart VS Code manually.

Once installed, you should see Wokwi options in your VS Code command palette (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type "Wokwi").

<h3>Important Note on the "Draw" Feature in VS Code</h3>

The "draw" feature, which allows you to visually design your circuit diagrams directly within the VS Code extension, is a premium feature that requires a **Wokwi subscription.**

**If you do not have a subscription and wish to use the circuit drawing capabilities, you can do so for free directly on the Wokwi website.**

<h2>Get Started with Wokwi</h2>

To avoid the subscription requirement for the drawing feature and access the full range of Wokwi's free simulation tools, simply visit the official Wokwi website: https://wokwi.com/

You can create, edit, and run your simulations directly in your browser without any downloads or subscriptions for the basic functionality.
